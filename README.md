# web3-resolver

With this tool, you are able to view web3.0 sites registered on the blockchain by Unstoppable Domains.

#### #Specifications:
 All requests go through a bundle system managed by broswerify that converts the initial Node.js code into a simpler format that is easy to interpret for browsers.

If you are thinking of forking this project & improving it for your purposes, consider installing the bundle tool.

The Node.js source code can be found in the [assets/js](https://github.com/heyolaniran/web3-resolver/blob/master/assets/js/ipfs.js) directory in the ipfs.js file.

I hope you will find it useful.
